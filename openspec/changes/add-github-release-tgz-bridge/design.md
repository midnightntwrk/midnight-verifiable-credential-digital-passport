## Context

The npmjs release train from `add-npm-release-pipeline` is fully implemented but has never executed a publication: the `MIDNIGHTCI_NPMJS_TOKEN` secret cannot be granted (organizational dependency outside this repository's control), the package 404s on npmjs, and the repository has zero git tags and zero GitHub Releases. The pack path (`artifacts:pack` → contract check → clean-consumer tarball test) and SBOM generation are battle-tested in CI and are reused verbatim. `check-security-workflows.mjs` (CI-enforced) asserts the publication workflow's exact job permission shape `contents: read` + `id-token: write`, dispatch-only triggering, the channel gate, and the npmjs registry lock; release-tooling unit tests exercise mutated copies of the workflow. Work lands on the `release-tgz` branch. See proposal.md for motivation and scope.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Distribute the gated tarball through GitHub Releases with a defined, reversible exit back to npmjs.
- Keep one dispatch surface (`publish.yml`), one gate, one trust chain — no second workflow, no input-mode matrix.
- Preserve every security property the self-check enforces today, re-asserted for the bridge shape.
- Fail closed on tag/version/commit drift before any expensive step.

**Non-Goals:**

- Any second registry target (GitHub Packages rejected — confusion with the npmjs target).
- Supporting the `snapshot` channel during the bridge (structurally incompatible with pre-created tags).
- A `releases/latest/download` unversioned convenience URL (silent major jumps; nondeterministic CI).
- Consumer-side enforcement of verification (documented, not mandated).
- Changes to the package contract, flake output, or pack/contract-check semantics.

## Decisions

### D1: Comment out the npmjs steps inside `publish.yml`, not a mode input or a second workflow

Steps 4 (npm CLI trusted-publishing check), 10 (dist-tag snapshot), and 12–15 (publish, propagation wait, dist-tag verify, registry consumer test) are commented out under a single `# BRIDGE (temporary): …` marker block carrying restore instructions; the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` job env is commented with them. The bridge steps are added in place. Alternatives rejected: a `registry:` dispatch input (a mode matrix to build, test, and later delete, for a bridge that can only ever do one thing while the token is absent) and a separate `release.yml` workflow (duplicates the gate and checkout/setup scaffolding; splits the trust chain). Because the permission shape changes either way, the self-check must be updated regardless (see D5) — so the minimal-diff argument for a separate file disappears, and comments make the temporary nature legible in review.

### D2: Tag reconciliation runs first, as its own step, sharing the version scheme module

A new early step (right after `release-resolve-context.sh`, before setup and the expensive gate) reconciles the operator tag: the dispatch input `tag` must (a) exist, (b) point at `github.sha` of the dispatch ref, and (c) equal `v<resolved-full-version>` with the scheme (`<base>`, `<base>-rc<N>`) imported from a helper exported by refactoring `prepare-release-version.mjs` — never duplicated. Failing here is deliberate: failing at the version step would burn the ~20-minute gate first. The snapshot channel is rejected in `release-resolve-context.sh` with a bridge-specific message (the checker requires the `channel` input to keep offering exactly `snapshot|rc|release`, so the option stays and fails closed). `GITHUB_SHA` and outputs flow through step `env:` only (template-injection hygiene). The workflow still never creates, moves, or deletes refs.

### D3: Release creation via `gh` CLI in `run:`, env-indirected — no third-party release action

`gh release create`/`gh release upload` run in `run:` steps with `GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}` passed via the step env map (the checker forbids `${{ }}` inside `run:` but the env map is the established pattern). The gh CLI is preinstalled on the runner and avoids vendoring an external release action into a security-reviewed workflow. Rerun semantics mirror the npm path's idempotency: if the release already exists, the run verifies each existing asset's digest against the locally packed artifact — identical assets make the rerun a successful no-op; any drift fails closed (`--clobber` is never used blindly).

### D4: Asset pipeline order — pack → sums → attest → create with assets → verify digests → URL consumer test

SHA256SUMS is generated over the tarball, SBOM, and contract report before the release exists; the release is created in one shot with all assets and the generated body (channel, version, install URL, checksums, `sha256sum`/`gh attestation verify` one-liners, changelog link). After upload, a verification step re-downloads nothing — it compares the registry-reported asset digests (`gh release view --json assets`) against the local digests and fails on mismatch. `actions/attest-build-provenance` (pinned to a full commit SHA, as the checker requires) attests each uploaded asset with its sha256 digest. The 90-day evidence artifact upload is unchanged and still runs.

### D5: Self-check and its tests are updated to assert the bridge contract, exactly

`assertPublishWorkflow` in `check-security-workflows.mjs` changes only its permission assertion: every publication job must grant exactly `contents: write`, `id-token: write`, `attestations: write` (top level and job level). Dispatch-only, channel options, gate-presence, registry lock, template-injection hygiene, SHA pinning, and checkout hygiene assertions are untouched. The release-tooling unit tests that mutate workflow copies gain mutations for the new shape (widened/narrowed permissions, a bridge step interpolating `${{ }}`, an unpinned action) and assert failures. This is the deliberate mechanism the checker exists for — it pins the exact shape, and the bridge updates the pin.

### D6: URL-mode consumer test extends the existing multi-mode script

`test-release-package-consumers.mjs` gains `--release-url <url>` alongside its tarball and registry modes, reusing the clean-project harness, the registry-resolved dependency install, the round-trip, and the long-path workaround from tarball mode. The URL is constructed from the release just created, proving the real distribution channel end-to-end.

### D7: Consumer documentation is generic and channel-shaped

Root README and package README gain a "Installing from GitHub Releases (temporary bridge)" section: pin the versioned `releases/download/<tag>/<file>.tgz` URL in `dependencies`, the lockfile freezes it, upgrades are a one-line URL edit; note that a direct URL dependency is not an exotic *sub*dependency (no `blockExoticSubdeps` exemption) and carries no registry publish date (no `minimumReleaseAge` applicability); include the verification commands as optional. No consumer repository is named anywhere.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Mutable release assets — an admin can replace a pinned URL's bytes] → Accepted (grilling Q7); mitigated by artifact attestations (replacement is detectable by `gh attestation verify`), documented residual risk in the runbook, and tag-deletion rulesets where the org permits.
- [Operator dispatches from a branch HEAD the tag doesn't mark] → Reconciliation fails closed within seconds, before setup or the gate, with a message naming the mismatch.
- [Tag/version drift (e.g. tag `v0.1.0-rc2` with `rc_index` defaulting to 1)] → Same early fail-closed; the runbook's dispatch procedure names the expected tag for each channel.
- [gh CLI version drift on the runner image] → The digest-compare and no-op paths use stable `gh release` JSON fields; acceptable for a temporary bridge.
- [Bridge quietly becomes permanent] → The exit condition is a spec requirement and a runbook section; the bridge marker block in the workflow names the restore procedure.
- [Commented YAML is not parser-validated] → The restore procedure is exercised by the exit change's own gate run; the self-check still validates the live bridge shape.

## Migration Plan

1. Implement on `release-tgz`; offline verification: `pnpm run all` (including the updated self-check and release-tooling mutations) and `pnpm run artifacts:pack` green.
2. Dry-run reconciliation locally: create a scratch tag, run the new step logic against it for match/mismatch cases; delete the scratch tag.
3. First bridge dispatch (operator, after merge): create and push `v0.1.0-rc1` on the release commit, dispatch `channel=rc` from the permitted branch, verify prerelease assets, checksums, attestations, and the URL consumer test in the run.
4. Rollback (any time): the bridge is additive to git history — reverting the change's commits restores the npm path verbatim; existing releases remain as inert artifacts until deleted by an admin.
5. Exit (token granted): first `release`-channel npmjs publication succeeds → single follow-up change uncomments steps 4/10/12–15, removes bridge steps and the `github-release-distribution` requirements, updates docs.

## Open Questions

None blocking. The release-notes template wording and the exact gh JSON field selection are safely deferrable to implementation review.
