# npmjs publication runbook

This is the operator runbook for publishing
`@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport` to the public
npm registry. It is adapted from the sibling
[`midnight-verifiable-credentials`](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credentials)
publication runbook, reduced to this repository's single publishable package.

Publication is **manual-dispatch only**: the
[`publish.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow is the single
door to the registry, and the first thing it does — before any build, pack, or
publish step — is validate the channel/branch gate
(`tooling/scripts/release-resolve-context.sh`):

| Channel   | Allowed branches      | Version scheme                          | npm dist-tag |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `snapshot`| `develop` only        | `<base>-snapshot.<run>.<short-sha>`      | `snapshot`   |
| `rc`      | `develop` or `main`   | `<base>-rc<N>`                           | `rc`         |
| `release` | `main` only           | `<base>`                                 | `latest`     |

Versioning is **stateless**: the base semver (`0.1.0`) lives in the root and
package manifests (they must agree, and the workflow fails if they don't); the
workflow stamps the channel version only into its ephemeral checkout. Nothing
is committed, tagged, or pushed by a publication.

## Ownership

| Concern                          | Owner                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Technical (workflow, scripts, release decisions) | `@midnightntwrk/ex-identus` |
| Credentials, dispatch, incidents | `@midnightntwrk/mn-sre`      |
| Security escalation              | `@midnightntwrk/mn-security` |

CODEOWNERS routes the release surface (workflow, scripts, this guide) to all
three teams: changes to the publication path require their review.

## Authentication and token policy

- The workflow authenticates with the org automation token stored as the
  repository secret **`MIDNIGHTCI_NPMJS_TOKEN`** (the sibling repositories use
  the same path).
- The token should be a **granular access token** with *read and write*
  permissions on packages in the `@midnight-ntwrk` scope, configured to
  **bypass two-factor authentication** (automation tokens cannot complete
  interactive 2FA). For the first publication it must also carry the right to
  **create new packages** in the `@midnight-ntwrk` organization.
- The token is consumed through the environment (`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`) and the
  `.npmrc` written by `setup-node` — **never** through workflow inputs,
  command arguments, repository files, or logs. The publish script refuses to
  run without it and the registry is hard-locked to
  `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.
- **Future OIDC migration:** the workflow verifies in every run that the
  installed npm CLI supports trusted publishing (npm ≥ 11.5.1), so moving to
  npm OIDC trusted publishing (dropping the token entirely) is a config
  change, not a workflow rewrite. Removing the token is a future org-policy
  step.
- The publication itself runs with `id-token: write` (npm provenance) and
  `contents: read` only; checkouts persist no credentials — both enforced by
  the CI self-check (`check:security-workflows`).

## Pre-dispatch gates

Before dispatching any publication, verify:

1. **Secret present:** `MIDNIGHTCI_NPMJS_TOKEN` exists on the repository
   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) and is current. The workflow
   fails before publishing if it is absent.
2. **CI green** on the branch you will dispatch from (`develop` for `rc` /
   `snapshot`, `main` for `release`) — the publish run re-runs the full gate
   itself, but a red CI lane means the dispatch will waste a run and fail.
3. **Catalog is tight:** `node tooling/scripts/workspace-catalog.mjs
   --publishable-paths` prints exactly
   `packages/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport`. If any other
   workspace appears, stop and fix the catalog first — private evidence
   workspaces (e.g. the smoke consumer) must never be publishable.
4. **Version and changelog current:** the root and family package manifests
   carry the same base version (`0.1.0` until the first bump), and the
   `[Unreleased]` sections of both changelogs reflect what is being released.
   A supplied `version` input must equal the manifest base — the manifests are
   the source of truth (stateless versioning).

## First release (dispatch procedure)

The first publication creates the package in the `@midnight-ntwrk` org:

1. Confirm every pre-dispatch gate above.
2. On the **Actions** tab, choose **Publish** → **Run workflow**:
   - **Branch:** `develop`
   - **Channel:** `rc`
   - **Version:** `0.1.0`
   - **rc_index:** `1`
3. Dispatch and watch the run. Expected sequence: context resolution → tool
   setup → npm CLI check → full gate (`pnpm run all`) → smoke round-trip →
   version preparation (`0.1.0-rc1`, stamped only into the ephemeral checkout)
   → pack + contract check + tarball consumer test → SPDX SBOMs → dist-tag
   snapshot → evidence artifact upload → publish with provenance →
   propagation wait → dist-tag verification → registry-mode consumer test →
   summary.
4. Any step failing means **nothing was published** unless the failure is
   after the publish step; versions are immutable, so a partial failure before
   publish is always safe to re-dispatch.

## Post-publication verification

After a green run:

```sh
npm view @midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport --json
npm view @midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport dist-tags
npm view @midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport@0.1.0-rc1 dist.attestations
```

Confirm:

- the version is **public** on npmjs (no `private: true` masking),
- the dist-tag matches the channel (`rc` for `0.1.0-rc1`) and **`latest` is
  untouched** (still the previous stable release — absent before the first
  `release` dispatch),
- the **provenance attestation** is present (published with `--provenance`),
- the release-evidence artifact (tarballs, SBOMs, dist-tag snapshot) is
  attached to the workflow run,
- a clean install works from the registry:
  `npm install @midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport@0.1.0-rc1`
  (the workflow already ran this check from the registry).

Finally, record the release: add the install instructions with the live
version to the README and move the `[Unreleased]` entries to the released
version in the package and root changelogs.

## Retry and rollback

- **Retry after a failure before publish:** re-dispatch with the same inputs.
  Nothing was published; the run starts fresh.
- **Retry after a success (no-op):** re-dispatching the same channel, version,
  and index succeeds as an **idempotent no-op** — the publish script detects
  the already-published version, verifies the dist-tag, and skips
  republishing. This is the safe answer to "did it finish?".
- **Drifted dist-tag:** if a dist-tag points at the wrong version (e.g. `rc`
  left on an older rc), re-dispatch the same inputs — the script **repairs**
  the tag (`npm dist-tag add <name>@<version> <tag>`) instead of republishing.
  Manual repair also works: `npm dist-tag add @midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport@<version> <tag>`.
- **A bad version is live:** npm versions are immutable. Within 72 hours of
  publication, `npm unpublish` the exact version (org policy permitting);
  otherwise deprecate it (`npm deprecate <name>@<version> "message"`) and cut
  the next rc/stable. Never move `latest` onto an untested version — repair
  tags only with versions the pipeline published and verified.

## Incident response

1. **Suspected token compromise:** revoke `MIDNIGHTCI_NPMJS_TOKEN` in the npm
   org immediately, rotate the repository secret, and page
   `@midnightntwrk/mn-sre`.
2. **Audit:** list recent versions and publish times
   (`npm view <name> time --json`), cross-check against the GitHub Actions
   publication runs (each has an evidence artifact), and confirm provenance
   attestations cover every published version.
3. **Escalation:** involve `@midnightntwrk/mn-security` for anything
   confirmed malicious (unexpected versions, moved `latest`, attestation
   anomalies). Freeze publications by revoking the token — dispatch-only
   publication means no automation can publish while the token is dead.
4. **Post-incident:** file the incident per org process; if the root cause is
   in this pipeline, fix it in a PR reviewed by the CODEOWNERS teams before
   re-enabling publication.
