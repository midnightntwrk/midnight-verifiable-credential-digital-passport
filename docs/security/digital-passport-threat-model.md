## 1. System under discussion

The npm package
`@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport`
(`packages/midnight-verifiable-credential-digital-passport/`) implements the
**digital-passport verifiable-credential family**: five committed identity
claims, selective disclosure, an age-over-threshold zero-knowledge predicate,
presentation requests, and the issuance/presentation protocol messages, as
Compact `pure circuit`s plus off-chain compact-value codecs.

Runtime dependencies: `@midnight-ntwrk/credential-compact` (the generic
VC/VP/protocol core, staged into `core-compact-staging/` at build time) and
`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`. The package contains no network code, no
key storage, and no ledger views; everything it exports is either a pure
circuit or a codec.

### Assets

| Asset | Protection goal |
|---|---|
| Claim values (first/last name, date of birth, document number, issuing state) | Confidentiality: never leave the holder except when explicitly disclosed |
| Claim openings (blinding factors) | Confidentiality: holder-only |
| Holder signing key (Jubjub) | Confidentiality + integrity: presentation proofs |
| Issuer signing key (Jubjub) | Integrity: credential issuance proofs |
| Credential (public envelope + commitments) | Integrity + authenticity |
| Presentation request | Integrity: verifier's challenge must bind the presentation |

### Actors

- **Issuer** — mints the credential; proves the issuance context with its key
  (`issuerVerificationMethodRef`).
- **Holder** — owns the credential, the private parts (values + openings), and
  the holder key; constructs presentations and signs the presentation context.
- **Verifier** — authors a presentation request and checks the presentation
  against it.
- **Prover host** — whatever machine executes the circuits (see §8).

## 2. Claims set and privacy

*Boundary: `src/digital-passport-credential/claims.compact`.*

The family commits five claims; **no claim value is carried in the clear** in
the credential body (the core-defined `NoPublicClaims` type
(`core-compact-staging/credentials/types.compact`), selected for this family
by the `VC<NoPublicClaims, …>` instantiation in
`src/digital-passport-credential.compact`):

- `firstName` (padded to `Bytes<64>`), `lastName` (`Bytes<64>`) —
  `firstNameCommitment` / `lastNameCommitment`
- `dateOfBirth` (`Uint<32>`, day number) — `dateOfBirthCommitment`
- `documentNumber` (`Bytes<32>`, **nullable**) — `documentNumberCommitment`
- `issuingState` (`Bytes<32>`) — `issuingStateCommitment`

Each value is hidden behind `persistentCommit<...>(value, opening)` with a
holder-chosen 32-byte opening. The commitments are hashed into a single
`claimRoot` (`digitalPassportClaimRoot`), domain-separated with the literal
`"midnight:vc:digital-passport:v1"`, which is itself covered by the issuer's
signature via the credential body root.

**Threats addressed**

- *Issuer-side/custodian exfiltration of claim values:* the issuer sees values
  at issuance (unavoidable — it authored them), but the issued credential is
  safe to store or forward: values are not recoverable from commitments
  without the openings.
- *Commitment-malleability/collision attacks on the root:* domain separation
  plus `persistentHash`/`persistentCommit`; a manipulated claim set cannot
  reproduce the same `claimRoot`.
- *Null document number ambiguity:* absence is encoded as
  `documentNumberNullCommitment()` — a domain-separated sentinel that is **not
  in the range of `persistentCommit`**, so no `(value, opening)` pair can ever
  claim to "reveal" an absent document number. Private-parts and presentation
  validation both guard the sentinel (`claims.compact`,
  `helpers.compact`).

**Residual risks.** First/last names padded to 64 bytes have low entropy; a
verifier that learns a name once can confirm it later by re-deriving the
commitment (openings protect against *derivation*, not *confirmation*
attacks). This is inherent to plain commitments and is why disclosure requires
the holder's presentation signature (§6).

## 3. Selective-disclosure boundaries

*Boundary: `DigitalPassportDisclosures` (`model.compact`), presentation
validation (`helpers.compact`), core VP envelope
(`core-compact-staging/credentials/vp.compact`).*

A presentation (`DigitalPassportPresentation`) carries, per claim, an
independent `reveal*` flag with the value and its opening. Validation
(`assertValidDigitalPassportPresentation`) re-derives each *revealed*
commitment and requires it to equal the credential's — a disclosure that does
not match the credential fails. Unrevealed claims contribute nothing beyond
their already-public commitments.

What a presentation **always** exposes (by design, covered by the holder's
presentation signature): the schema reference, issuer verification-method
reference, explicit holder binding, and the presentation's own digests. What
it **never** exposes without a flag: any claim value or opening.

**Threats addressed**

- *Over-disclosure by tampering:* flipping a `reveal*` flag without a valid
  `(value, opening)` for that claim fails the re-derivation assert.
- *Cross-credential splicing:* disclosures must match **this** credential's
  commitments, and the presentation must carry a proof matching the explicit
  holder binding (`assertProofMatchesExplicitHolderBinding`) plus a valid
  presentation-context signature over the presentation body root
  (`assertValidPresentationContextProof`), so values cannot be borrowed from
  another credential.
- *Verifier-forced disclosure:* the circuits only ever *verify* what was
  disclosed; the request-satisfaction check (§5) fails closed when a required
  disclosure is absent, but nothing lets a verifier extract an unrevealed
  value.

**Residual risks.** Once a value is disclosed to a verifier, that verifier
holds it in the clear; replay-protection of the disclosure itself is the
challenge-binding (§5), not confidentiality. Correlation across verifiers via
stable commitments (the same credential presented twice presents identical
commitments) is possible unless holders use per-presentation fresh credentials
— out of scope for v1.

## 4. Age-over-threshold predicate

*Boundary: `assertValidDigitalPassportAgePredicate` (`helpers.compact`).*

Instead of revealing `dateOfBirth`, the holder can prove
`currentDay - dateOfBirthDays >= ageThresholdYears * 365` with the date of
birth supplied as a **private witness** bound to the committed
`dateOfBirthCommitment` (mismatched witnesses fail before the predicate is
evaluated). The threshold is a `Uint<8>`; positivity is asserted upstream of
this circuit — `assertValidDigitalPassportPresentationRequest` requires a
positive `requestedAgeThresholdYears` and
`assertValidDigitalPassportPresentation` asserts `ageThresholdYears > 0` —
while the predicate circuit itself evaluates only the bound witness and the
threshold comparison.

**Threats addressed**

- *False age claim:* the witness must open the credential's actual date-of-birth
  commitment; a younger witness fails the binding assert, an older future
  witness fails `currentDay >= dateOfBirthDays`.
- *Under-threshold acceptance:* the non-strict `>=` threshold assert exits the
  circuit when unmet (fail-closed asserts, verified by
  `src/test/age-predicate.test.ts`).

**Trust boundary (explicit in code).** `currentDay` is **caller-supplied
policy input** (`helpers.compact` marks it as a TRUST BOUNDARY). A malicious
or sloppy integrator that derives "today" from an untrusted source accepts
predicates against a forged clock. Acceptance decisions must feed this
argument from a trustworthy time source.

**Residual risks.** The predicate uses calendar years of 365 days
(`ageThresholdYears * 365`): people born on a leap-day-adjacent window may
satisfy a threshold up to ~1 day early/late relative to exact calendar age.
No timezone semantics are defined; `dateOfBirthDays` and `currentDay` must
come from the same day-numbering convention.

## 5. Presentation-request validation

*Boundary: `DigitalPassportPresentationRequest` (`model.compact`),
`assertValidDigitalPassportPresentationRequest`,
`digitalPassportPresentationRequestFromProtocol`,
`assertDigitalPassportPresentationSatisfiesRequest` (`helpers.compact`),
protocol envelopes (`validation.compact`).*

A verifier's request declares, per claim, whether disclosure is required
(`require*Disclosure`, `requireAgeOverThreshold` with
`requestedAgeThresholdYears`), references the issuer's verification method,
and carries a non-zero `verifierChallengeHash`. Validation asserts the version
and schema identifiers (`midnight:vc:digital-passport` / `digital-passport:v1`,
major version 1), a positive threshold when the predicate is requested, and a
set challenge.

Satisfaction checking binds the presentation to the request: identical schema
refs across request/credential/presentation; the request's issuer verification
method must equal the credential's (contract address **and** method id); the
presentation proof's `challengeHash` must equal the request's
`verifierChallengeHash`; and every required disclosure must be present with
the **exact** requested threshold.

**Threats addressed**

- *Relay/replay of a presentation to a different verifier session:* the
  presentation signature covers the challenge; a presentation built for
  challenge A does not verify against request challenge B.
- *Issuer substitution:* the request pins the issuer verification method to
  the credential's, so a credential from a different issuer cannot satisfy a
  request aimed at a specific issuer.
- *Threshold bait-and-switch:* the presentation's proven threshold must equal
  the requested one exactly — proving "over 18" does not satisfy "over 21".
- *Weaker-than-requested acceptance:* every `require*` flag fails closed when
  unmet.

**Trust boundary (explicit in code).** The request helper proves *semantics
only*; it "does not authenticate who authored the request" (comment on
`assertDigitalPassportPresentationSatisfiesRequest`). Transport-layer
authentication of the verifier (who really issued this request) is the
integrator's protocol responsibility.

## 6. Holder binding and issuance integrity

*Boundary: explicit-DID binding assertions
(`core-compact-staging/credentials/holder-bindings.compact`), issuance
validation (`validation.compact`), proofs (`proofs.compact`).*

The family pins `HolderBindingProfile.explicitDid` on every request and
submission protocol message (issuance included); the presentation
`ResultMessage` (`present.compact`) carries no holder-binding field — its
validation covers only the protocol envelope and the response bit.
Issuance requires an explicit holder binding, a set holder challenge, and a
holder public key that must match between request and result; the issued
credential's holder binding must match the request's
(`assertMatchingExplicitHolderBindings`). Credential and presentation proofs
are Jubjub signatures over domain-separated, context-tagged payloads
(`issuanceContextTag` / `presentationContextTag`) that bind the body root, the
signer's verification-method reference, creation time, the challenge, and the
signature points (`proofs.compact`) — a proof for one context does not verify
in the other, and a proof for a modified body does not verify at all.

**Threats addressed:** credential forgery without the issuer key; presentation
forgery without the holder key; holder substitution between issuance request
and result; cross-context proof replay (issuance proof replayed as
presentation or vice versa).

**Residual risks:** issuer key rotation and DID-method resolution are outside
the package — the circuits compare method references; they do not resolve
them. Wallets must verify the issuer's DID actually resolves to the signing
key.

## 7. Status and revocation assumptions

*Boundary: `assertValidNoStatusBinding`
(`core-compact-staging/credentials/status-bindings.compact`), invoked by
`assertValidDigitalPassportCredential` (`helpers.compact`).*

Family v1 binds **no status**: credentials carry `NoStatusBinding`
(intentionally empty). There is no revocation check anywhere in the package.
The only liveness control is the optional expiration envelope
(`hasExpiration`/`expiresAt` with `expiresAt >= issuedAt` enforced by the core
envelope validator).

**Consequences for integrators.** A verifier that accepts a presentation
cannot learn from this package whether the issuer revoked the credential or
whether it expired — expiration must be checked by the caller against a
trusted clock, and revocation requires a future status-registry integration
(the core supports a `revocationRegistry` binding mode; this family does not
use it). Until then, the threat model assumption is: **accepting a credential
means trusting the issuer for its lifetime**, with revocation handled
out-of-band.

## 8. Proving and proof-server trust

*Boundary: `pureCircuits` surface (`src/index.ts`, `src/contract.ts`),
runtime stack (`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`, `credential-compact`),
fixtures (`src/testing/credential-fixtures.ts`).*

Everything in this package is a **pure circuit**: deterministic functions of
their inputs, no ledger state. Executing them via the exported
`pureCircuits` is a local, in-process evaluation — the package makes no
network calls and ships no proof server; tests and the consumer smoke
round-trip run entirely offline under the `undeployed` network id.

When these circuits are composed into deployed Midnight contracts, zero-
knowledge proofs are produced by the Compact prover stack. The trust
properties:

- **Witness locality.** Claim values and openings are witness material. In
  this package's model the holder (or whoever runs the verification) supplies
  them as circuit arguments in their own process. If an integrator moves
  proving to a **remote proof server**, every witness sent to it is exposed to
  that server: the proof server must then be treated as a trusted holder-side
  component.
- **Assertion integrity.** The validation circuits are fail-closed `assert`s;
  accepting their result means trusting the execution environment (local
  runtime, or a valid ZK proof when deployed). The package does not, and
  cannot, attest *which* environment ran it.
- **Signature vs proof.** Credential/presentation authenticity inside this
  package is carried by Jubjub signatures in cleartext fields (`Proof`), not
  by ZK; the ZK properties matter only for the predicate (§4) and for future
  deployed usage.

**Residual risks.** A malicious execution host can lie about a circuit's
outcome (return without throwing). Deployment integrations must rely on the
Midnight network's proof verification, not on an attestation from the
prover host.

## 9. Assumption register (summary)

| # | Assumption | Boundary | Violation consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Openings stay holder-private | `claims.compact` commitments | Full claim disclosure |
| A2 | `currentDay` from a trusted clock | `assertValidDigitalPassportAgePredicate` | Age predicate accepted against forged time |
| A3 | Verifier authentication happens in transport | request-satisfaction helper comment | Request spoofing / challenge phishing |
| A4 | No revocation is acceptable for v1 | `NoStatusBinding` | Revoked credentials verify as valid |
| A5 | Expiration checked by the caller against trusted time | core envelope validator | Expired credentials accepted |
| A6 | Prover host is holder-trusted (or local) | `pureCircuits` + runtime | Witness leakage to remote prover |
| A7 | Issuer DID resolves to the signing key (caller duty) | `issuerVerificationMethodRef` asserts | Impersonation via un-resolved method refs |
| A8 | Day numbering is consistent between DOB and current day | `Uint<32>` day fields | ±1-day age boundary errors |

## 10. Out of scope

Ledger-level security (contract deployment, on-chain DID registries), wallet
key custody, transport protocols (e.g. OpenID4VC), the proof-server's own
attack surface, and organizational controls — each belongs to their owning
component. Publishing/release supply-chain posture is covered by the
repository hardening change this document accompanies, not by the credential
circuits.
