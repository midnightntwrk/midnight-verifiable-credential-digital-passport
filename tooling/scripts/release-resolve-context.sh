# Publication context resolution (npm-publication: "Publication channels and
# branch gating"). Ported from midnight-verifiable-credentials. Runs FIRST in
# the publish workflow: every gate below fails the run before any build, pack,
# or publish step executes.
#
#   usage: release-resolve-context.sh --channel <snapshot|rc|release> \
#            [--version <base>] [--rc-index <n>]
#
# Env:
#   GITHUB_EVENT_NAME  must be workflow_dispatch (manual dispatch only)
#   GITHUB_REF         the dispatch ref (refs/heads/<branch>)
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT      (optional) receives channel/branch/npm-tag/base-version
#
# Rules:
#   - publication only through manual dispatch (no push/PR/schedule events)
#   - snapshot: develop only
#   - rc:       develop or main
#   - release:  main only
#   - rc_index: positive integer, and only valid for the rc channel
#   - version:  optional stable semantic version
